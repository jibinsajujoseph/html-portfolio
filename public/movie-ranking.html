<hr/>

<h3>Maheshinte Prathikaram</h3>
<p>The film beautifully intertwines elements of comedy, drama, and romance, while capturing the essence of rural Kerala life. It stands out for its realistic portrayal of characters and situations, making it a heartwarming and relatable story.</p>

<h3>Njandukalude Nattil Oridavela</h3>
<P>The film stands out for its light-hearted yet sensitive portrayal of a family grappling with a serious health crisis. Instead of focusing on the tragedy, it delves into the dynamics of family relationships, the challenges they face, and the humor they find in everyday life.</P>

<h3>Minnal Murali</h3>
<p>The film is a refreshing take on the superhero genre, blending local culture, humor, and emotions with the thrill of action-packed sequences. It's not just the spectacle of superpowers that drives the narrative, but also the deep exploration of the characters' personal journeys, struggles, and moral dilemmas. </p>
